# Multiple Commands for VS Code

A simple extension for VS Code which allows mulitple commands to be bound to a single keyboard shortcut.

## Features

The original intention of this extension was to allow the trimming of whitespace to be performed on the execution of a file save, emulating existing functionality in Sublime Text 2/3.

To provide more modularity and maleability, the extension now reads the desired commands from `'commands.json'`.

The command can be bound to any key. Follow VS Code's instructions on keybinding.

## Examples

The default commands in `'commands.json'` are `'editor.action.trimTrailingWhitespace'` and `'workbench.action.files.save'`.

## Requirements

- VS Code

## Known Issues

- None

## Release Notes
